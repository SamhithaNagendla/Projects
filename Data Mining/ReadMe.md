# Data Mining Labs

# Motivation
The labs were completed as a part of the Data Mining (CSE 5334) course at The University of Texas at Arlington. The course is well structured to understand the concepts of Data Mining.

# List of Projects

Project 1 : Exploratory Analysis over Covid19 Dataset

Description : To analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need.



Project 2 : Classification - Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbors

Description : Used cardio and titanic datasets to demonstrate classifications using Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbors.



Project 3 : Association Analysis - Apriori Algorithm

Description : Python Implementation of Apriori Algorithm for finding Frequent sets and Association Rules.
