# Advanced Database Topics Labs
Most of the projects will be done using  Map-Reduce, Apache Spark, Apache Pig, Apache Hive and Spark GraphX.
The software used for the projects is open-source, free, platform independent, and well-suited for Java. 
You can do most of the projects on your own PC/laptop under any platform (Linux, MAC OS X, MS Windows, etc)

# Getting Started
Projects were done on the Expanse cluster at SDSC (San Diego Supercomputer Center).

# Motivation
The labs were completed as a part of the Advanced Database Topics (CSE 6331) course at The University of Texas at Arlington. The course is well structured to understand the concepts of Advanced Database Topics.
